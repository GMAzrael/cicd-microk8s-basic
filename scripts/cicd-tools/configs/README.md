CONFIGS
=======

This directory will hold yaml files after applying values to the templates.
The templates have a few variables, like volume size and location, that need to be
specified.

NB: Please do not put any yaml files in this directory, as they most likely could be
deleted. This directory is populated by the yaml files in the template directory.
